# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

### Throughout this module we have analyzed ride-hailing data in multiple cities. Using Matplotlib and Pandas, we created graphs to visualize the results. 


## Results

#### See below for a summary DataFrame of metrics across the three types of cities. We can see Urban cities have the greatest number of rides and drivers while Rural has the least. In turn, Urban has the least expensive fares per rides and drivers, but Rural has the most expensive fares for each.

#### See below for a chart showing the total fares for each of the three types of cities across a few months. Urban cities have the highest total fares across the three months and Rural have the least. If we take a look at above chart the high total fares in Urban cities can be correlated with the high ride and driver count.

## Summary 

#### These results show discrepancies between the three city types. Here are some recommendations for how to company can address them: 
* Advertise in Rural and Suburban cities to promote more rides in these areas
* Lower the cost of the fares in Rural and Suburban so the average fare cost will be fair across the three types 
* Hire more drivers in Rural and Suburban cities
